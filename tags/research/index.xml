&lt;p&gt;On the first day at Lawrence Berkeley National Labs (LBL), I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to expect. I arrived there an hour early since I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to get caught up in traffic. Later I got my badge and off-hours parking permit, then I headed over to the Molecular Foundry. I went through the orientation for the inorganic facility there and left to meet a friend. We got lunch and I headed back to LBL to meet the scientist, Dr. Tev Kuykendall, that would be training me. He continued the orientation with me and showed me around the labs before I left for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
